01/23/18: Feedback to Kabir on potential improvements to make on our team

1. Need a fully designated BA for team IO (solution: hire a new BA)
2. Lack of cross-discipline/cross-team knowledge (solution: pair programming across disciplines)
3. Lack of a priority/decision maker during planning/grooming or even to make a definitive answer (solution: a. Saud become more involved or b. Scrum master help more to prioritize or c. #1 above
4. The team is not really good at having constructive conversations (take the JIRA workflow as an example), we complain or say its why it is one way but not offering solutions or reasons. Even when I tried to offer different solutions, we just went back to how it was always done and my question is why?  If everything is always status quo or we do everything how we have always done it, we will never get better (solution: again I think a point person to facilitate the conversation and get the team to agree on outcomes. This could also be Praveen but he would have to change his current approach).
5. When in a room with Ganymede/IO most people are not speaking up or voicing their concerns or offering solutions. We canâ€™t do better if no one speaks up. (Solution: Everyone needs to contribute, not sure how we get them to contribute but it needs to happen, maybe #5 below would get them our of their shell)
6. Not necessarily an issue but I think we should raise collective team knowledge through lunchtime learning where everyone takes turns presenting/teaching on subjects of their interest
