01/23/18: Feedback to Kabir on potential improvements to make on our team

1. Need a fully designated BA for team IO (solution: hire a new BA)
2. Lack of cross-discipline/cross-team knowledge (solution: pair programming across disciplines)
3. Lack of a priority/decision maker during planning/grooming or even to make a definitive answer (solution: a. Saud become more involved or b. Scrum master help more to prioritize or c. #1 above
4. The team is not really good at having constructive conversations (take the JIRA workflow as an example), we complain or say its why it is one way but not offering solutions or reasons. Even when I tried to offer different solutions, we just went back to how it was always done and my question is why?  If everything is always status quo or we do everything how we have always done it, we will never get better (solution: again I think a point person to facilitate the conversation and get the team to agree on outcomes. This could also be Praveen but he would have to change his current approach).
5. When in a room with Ganymede/IO most people are not speaking up or voicing their concerns or offering solutions. We can’t do better if no one speaks up. (Solution: Everyone needs to contribute, not sure how we get them to contribute but it needs to happen, maybe #5 below would get them our of their shell)
6. Not necessarily an issue but I think we should raise collective team knowledge through lunchtime learning where everyone takes turns presenting/teaching on subjects of their interest

    I have been talking with Kabir about future milestones and one of my goals is to become a lead developer. As such I wanted to ask you your advice on things that I can do to increase my technical skills and work towards a lead dev. Additionally, any feedback or criticism you have about me or my code would be greatly appreciated.  
    
    To start down that path, Kabir has suggested I take the lead on facilitating and spear heading bi-weekly/weekly front-end design/architecture meetings. I wanted to run the idea past you and get your thoughts. See below for my thoughts: 
    
    Front-End Design Meeting Proposal:
    1.	Set up weekly/bi-weekly 30min-1hr meetings where we focus on one piece of the codebase and discuss redesign to make it more DRY, re-usable and modularized.  We would examine all areas in our application where we could share code (cross-UX team) via modules, design more elegant components, standardize functions and modules, and create a more performant/optimized application. 
    2.	Each time we meet there would be at least one volunteer (determined before-hand) to start discussion with a potential redesign idea (they would come with a written out example of their re-design
    3.	To ensure we do not affect sprint work, the action items for these meetings would be to size a potential refactor, document the new potential design on confluence, and create a technical debt story in the backlog.
     
    The benefits of these meetings are four-fold: 
    1.	These meetings will encourage cross-team collaboration
    2.	They aim to help all of us become better programmers because we can learn from each other
    3.	Improve the code quality and scalability of our overall app
    4.	Ultimately we would start building up architecture/design standards for our codebase documented on confluence.

* Became the Team expert on Jest tests (team would seek my advice)


* On 2/21/2018 Moved to Contituent App, became well versed in the entire application structure
