#### Talking to Human notes
Disscussion of how to coduct interviews with your potential market segments to gather information about the product to build

###### Key questions to keep in mind

* Who you want to learn from?
* What do you want to learn?
    * Go into every interview with a prepared list of questions
* How will you get to them?
* How can you ensure an effective session?
* How do you sense of what you learn?


### Who you want to learn from?
### Most important questions
* My target customer will be?
* The problem my customer wants to solve is?
* My customer’s need can be solved with?
* Why can’t my customer solve this today?
* The measurable outcome my customer wants to achieve is?
* My primary customer acquisition tactic will be?
* My earliest adopter will be?
* I will make money (revenue) by?
* My primary competition will be?
* I will beat my competitors primarily because of?
* My biggest risk to  financial viability is?
* My biggest technical or engineering risk is?
* What assumptions do we have that, if proven wrong, would cause this business to fail? (Tip: include market size in this list)

From this list you should be able to spot assumptions that are both highly important and fairly uncertain. Then focus on the most important issues.

### What do you want to learn? 
###### Sample questions from a proposed remote vet 
* Warm up: concise intro on the purpose of the conversation
* Warm up: basic questions about person and pet (name, age, picture)
* Who is your current vet? Can you tell me about how you found and chose him/her?
* Please describe the last time you had to take your pet to the vet for a checkup
* Walk me through the process of scheduling a time to visit the vet.
* What was frustrating about that experience?
* What did you like about that experience?
* Have you ever had an emergency visit to a vet? if yes, can you describe that experience for me?
* Have you ever thought about changing vets? why / why not?

###### One tip is to try to ask questions that start with words like who, what, why and how. Avoid questions that start with is, are, would, and do you.

* Observing whenever possible can lead to great insights

### How will you get to them?
#### Finding interview subjects
1. Try to get one degree of separation away (don’t interview your mom, your uncle, or your best friends)
2. Be creative (and don’t expect people to come to you)
3. Fish where the  fish are (and not where they are not)

#### Find the moment of pain
* If you can connect with people at the moment of their theoretical pain, it can be very illuminating.

#### Get referrals from your interviews
* walk out of every interview with at least 2 or 3 new candidates

#### Advice vs Selling
* Asking for advice should be your default method early in your customer discovery process
* Example of what you can say to person: "My name is Steve and [dropped name] told me you were one of the smartest people in the industry and you had really valuable advice to offer. I’m not trying to sell you anything, but was hoping to get 20 minutes of your time."

### How can you ensure an effective session?
* Do your Interviews in persion
* Talk to one person at a time
* Adding a note taker
* Start with a warm up and keep it human
* Disarm your own biases
* Get them to tell a story
* Look for solution hacks
* Understanding priority
* Listen, don't talk
* Follow your nose and drill down
* Parrot back or misrepresent to confirm
* Do A dry run
* Getting feedback on your product

#### How do you sense of what you learn?
* Take good notes
    * At start of each interview write up include: 
    * Name of interview subject
    * Date and time
    * Name of interviewer
    * In person or video conference
    * Photo (if you have one)
* Expect False Positives
* How many people to talk to? Talk to at least 50-100 people
* Lead with vision
