# Architecture and Design



## RESTful Practices
* Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services.
* API (application programming interface) - An interface that allows you to interact with data and servers
* A set of dedicated URLs that return pure data responses
* Kind of like a module in JS
* Microservices: Breaking your application into small pieces and the servers that perform helper functions for main application

### HTTP Methods 
* GET
* POST
* PUT
* DELETE

### HTTP Response Status Codes
* 2xx (success)
* 3xx (redirection)
* 4xx (client error)
* 5xx (server error)

### Searching, sorting, filtering and pagination

### Versioning
