# Story Mapping Notes

Based on Jeff Patton's [article](https://www.jpattonassociates.com/the-new-backlog/)

- Flat backlogs don't work because there is no high level view

## Build a Story Map

1. "Stories" or "User Activities" - Top of the story map
   - It is a big thing people do, something with a lot of steps
   - A story for Activity might read: As a consultant I want to manage my email so I can keep up with clients, colleagues, and friends
2. "User tasks"
   - Stories break down into other stories
   - A task is something that someone does to reach a goal
   - A user task is what users do to reach their goal, developer tasks are what developers do to create stories
   - IE: "Read an email", "response to a message" etc
3. TIME
   - Arrange the map with stories left to right (in the western world) in order a typical user would complete them
   - If there is no specific order then the order in which you explain how the system works is the order
   - Build the map in a way that helps tell the story

## Walk your map to test it

- You should have a fully assembled map in order to walk from begginining to end
- It will help you make sense of the whole journey

## Your software has a backbone and a skeleton and your map shows it

- Stories at the top are the backbone - the essential capabiliteies the system needs to have
- The cards hanging down look like ribs
- When it comes to prioritizing, you don't prioritize the backbone it just is
- You do prioritize ribs

## Plan using your backbone

- You don't prioritize your backbone - these are essential items
- Its how we build up those backone items that are prioritized, it is a 4 or 6 cynlinder engine
- Create horizontal swim lanes that signify the releases and prioritize above and below these lines

## Keep you map diplayed to communicate the big picture

- It is helpful to display the story throughout the building process in order to have continual discussions
- We slowly move across the backbone and down the priorities of each rib
- We build the system not a feature at a time but rather buil building up all major featuers a little at a time

# Story Map Concept

- Users = a map tells a story of person doing something to reach a goal
- Activities = Organize tasks bone by similar people at similiar times to reach a goal
- Backbone = Activities and taska at a higher goal level give story map its structure and arranged in a narrative flow
- User Tasks (Ribs) = short verb phrases basic build block of a map - IE: "Read an email", "response to a message"
- Goal-Level = actions users take have a goal level tied to user behavior - Three tiers
  - Summary: lots of tasks done in support of bigger goal
  - Functional: I'd expect to complete this task before taking a break
  - Sub-Functional: Smaller things done in suppoer a bigger task
- Narrative Flow = The left to right axis is organized to tell the story about your user to someone else
- Release Slice = Useing tape to identify slices of tasks that users might user your software for to reach their goals
  - The smallest numner of tasks that allow your specific target users to reach their gaol compose a viable product release
- Details, Details = break down high goal level tasks into:
  - Sub-tasks
  - Alternative tasks
  - Exceptions
  - Details
- Map Now & Later
  - Story maps are for undstanding now and imagining later

# Story Map Process

## Frame

- Create short product or feature brief to frame and constrain what you map, it is the big story

## Map the big picture

- Focus on getting the whole story
- Identify user activities
- Add additional users
- Start with the user type most critical to your product's success

## Explore

- Fill the body of your story map by breaking
- Think blue sky
- Look for variations
- Involve others

## Slice out Viable Releases

- Slice your map into holistic product releases
- For each release name the target outcomes and impact
- For each release identify product success metrics

## Slice out a development strategy

- Slice the first release fo your map into three or more deliver phases
