## Java Basics
* Pluralsight course]()

##### What is Java? 
* It is a Programming Language
    * Syntax, Control Flow, Object Oriented
* It is also a Runtime Environment
       * Config, security, Threading, Input/output
       * Java SE, EE, ME and Android
* JRE = Java runtime
    * Required to run JAva apps
    *  End users normally require only the JRE
* JDK =  Java Development Kit
    * Provides tools to create apps
    * JDK installation include JRE
    * The JDK produces a JAVA APP which then runs on top of a JRE which is read by Host environment

##### Statement Structure
* All lines ends with semi-colon
* Not whitespace sensitive. White space are just separators where the semi-colon is the end of the statement
##### Comments
* Line comments `//`
* Block comments `/* ... */`
* JavaDoc comments `/** ... */` You can write documentation in your code
    
##### Packages
* Provide organization and uniquess in class names
* naming convention is all lowercase
* user reverse domain name ie `package com.pluralsight`
* add further qualifiers within a company/group `package com.pluralsight.myproject`
* even further to add departments `package com.pluralsight.accounting.myproject`


##### Variables
* It is a Named data storage
* Strongly typed and we have to specify the type: `int dataValue`
* Value can be modified
* Rules allow us to use letters and numbers and must be started with a letter
* Convention of naming is camelCase

##### Primitive Variable Types
* Foundation of all other data types
* 4 types: Integer, Floating Point, Character and Boolean

###### INT types
   * byte: size is 8 bits
   * short: size is 16 bits
   * int: size is 32
   * long: size is 64, you have to put the capital L
###### FLoating points 
   * Allows you to store values containing fractional portion
   * There are 32 bit and 64 bit floating point type
   
###### Character and Boolean (true/false)
   * Different than strings
   * it is `char regularU = 'U';` or `char unicode = '\u0567'`
   * `boolean iLoveJava = true;`
