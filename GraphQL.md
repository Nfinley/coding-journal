# GraphQL

## What is it?

- It is a query language for APIs
- API Standard that provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to REST
- At its core, GraphQL enables declarative data fetching where a client can specify exactly what data it needs from an API.
- Instead of multiple endpoints that return fixed data structures, a GraphQL server only exposes a single endpoint and responds with precisely the data a client asked for.
