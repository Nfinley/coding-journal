# Clean Code

Notes from book club and reading

## Ch 1: Clean Code

- Total Cost of Owning a Mess
  - LeBlanc's law: Later equals never
  - The larger your code bass gets and the messier it gets, the less productivity you see
- Attitude
  - It is our job to defend the code with equal passion to our managers defending the schedule and requirements
- The Primal Conundrum
  - Developers know that previous messes slow them down, yet they feel the pressure to make messes in order to meet deadlines
  - However, the second part is wrong, you will not make the deadline by making a mess
  - The only way to make the deadline - the only way to go fast - is to keep the code as cleas as possible at all times
- The Art of Clean Code?
  - Requires use of "code-sense"
  - A programmer who can write clean code is an artist who can take a blank screen through a series of transformations until it is an elegantly coded system
- What is Clean Code?
  - Bjarne Stroustrup (Inventor of C++)
    - Likes code to be elegant and efficient, and clean code does one thing well
    - Clean code exhibits close attention to detail
    - Clean code is focused
  - Grady Booch (author of OO analysis and design with applications)
    - He says: Clean code is simple and direct
    - He takes a readability perspective and we should have 'crisp abstractions'
      - In that our code should be matter of fact as opposed to speculative
  - "Big" Dave Thomas (founder of OTI, gofather Eclipse strategy)
    - He focuses on readability but also asserts clean code makes it easy for other people to enhance it
    - He also ties cleaniness to tests
  - Michael Feathers (author of Working Effectively with Legacy Code)
    - Clean code looks like it was written by someone who cares
