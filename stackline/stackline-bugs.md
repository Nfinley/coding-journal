# Bugs found while navigating the app

1. 4/4/2018: On Atlas - When resizing a window on the retail sales there is an interesting color inversion that is happening with the graph (see image on desktop)
2. 4/4/2018: On Beacon - Viewed content in Apple, then when to a different tab in Beacon with MasterLock data and the Apple content showed up. It fixed the issue after I refreshed. Might be a caching issue or local storage issue
3. 4/4/2018: Navigation from product to product (breadcrumb) Ie: When viewing say Apple TV you can click on the name of product to get back to Apple but not intuitive
