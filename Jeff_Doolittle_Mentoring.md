# Session 1, December 5th, 2019

As I continue my software development journey I have found a need for advice and guidance in order to continue my technical and professional growth... enter [Jeff Doolittle](https://jeffdoolittle.com/). What drew me to reach out to Jeff, is his degree in transformational leadership, his tenure in the industry, his desire to help developers of all levels and to grow the whole person not just technical skills. What follows are my notes from my first conversation with Jeff.

## What is Software Architecture?

Software Architecture is a totally different realm of software development and really should be called Software Engineering. It is:

- A discipline, a mindset of an engineer who takes a long term view of a system
- The ability to look at a problem and design a system that can withstand the test of time
- Designing that long term, sustainable system _and_ creating and facilitating a process to implement the creation of your system design
- It is being a lion tamer, yes the lion could eat you (in this case the lion is the developer) but they respect the tamer

It just so happens that its Jeff's mission to evangelize how Software Architecture should be done, to help transform the industry, and find people who want to do it and do it well. Software Architecture is not just about programming, it's about understanding the whole picture including the user pain points and with that empathy. The software industry, in general, lacks emotional intelligence but if you possess it you can use these soft skills to your advantage and climb the corporate ladder(if that is your goal).

More to come on the definition of a Software Architecture.

## Where to start?

As we spoke my main question to him was "where do I start?". There is so much I want to learn and so much to learn that it can be paralyzing. He spoke about how when he first began his career there were new technologies coming out maybe every two months or so, and nowadays it is practically every week and soon it will be seconds. Point being you can't keep up and you have to learn how to learn not learn every new technology.

Back to "where do I start?" His answer:

> "You need to identify your North Star"

A North Star is your highest goal to attain, it is everything that guides you through your professional career and life, involving your family, and friends. It is not something that you will ever achieve because you should always continue to aim higher. When you think you found your North Star aim higher, and when you think you have found it again aim higher, rinse and repeat. However, this in itself can be daunting so you have to start somewhere, something that provides clarity.

I am not there yet but the way he phrased this and the passion he spoke with gives me hope that I can begin to find it.

On the path to finding it and during your career it is more important to what you say _no_ to than what you say _yes_ to.

## Homework, no Growthwork

> "The first law of thermodynamics, there is no value without sweat"

In other words, mentorship, just as most things worth anything in life is about putting in the hard work to get the most out of something.

Jeff considers himself to be a doctor diagnosing problems with systems, architecture, and processes. So my growthwork is as follows:

- Channel my inner pain investigator and put on my pain archeologist hat
- Then look to my current environment to see who is designing our architecture, who is responsible for it, and are we experiencing any areas of pain within the development and delivery lifecycle
- Take notes, what pain do I see? I must become a glutton for punishment
- Once a pain point is identified, rank it by effort, risk, and value

Pain is optional and the primary role of an Architect is to resolve pain.

#### Fun fact about Jeff

He wants to be his own real-life rock band, like Dave Groll. He already plays guitar, bass, piano and his next mission is drums.
