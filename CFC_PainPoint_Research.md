# CFC Pain Point Research - System Design Improvements

- Based on conversations with Jeff Doolittle, he asserts system architects are pain doctors and must find ways to relieve the pain. The following are notes on pain investigation within CFC to help uncover pain points in architecture, system processees and to rank them on effort, risk and value

## Pain Points

- Git branching strategies
- Current environment landscape
- Releasing code to production
- Build/Release pipeline speed and organization (ie how to cache node modules for reuse)
